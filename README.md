MATLAB assigments. From the first steps to the simulation of the motors with Simulink.

Content:
- Electrical Circuits (mostly mathematical representation of the student assigments)
- System Theorie (Transfer functions, Laplace, Bode diagrams, getting started with Simulink)
- Actuators (Matlab + Simulink motor simulation, P-, PD- and PID Controllers with Simulink)
